/*Code Overview
Random Number Generation : The RandomNumber function produces a random integer within a specified range, which is used to populate the array with random values.
Array Population& Output :
	FillArrayWithRandomNumbers prompts the user for the number of elements and fills the array with random integers between 1 and 100.
	PrintArray prints the array's elements to the console.
	Array Copying Using AddArrayElement :
AddArrayElement is used to add a new element to an array while updating its length.
CopyArrayUsingAddArrayElement copies elements from the source array to a destination array by repeatedly calling AddArrayElement.
Program Flow :
In main, the random number generator is seeded, the source array is filled with random numbers, its elements are copied to a second array, and both arrays are printed.


This detailed commentary should help you understand how the code functions step by step.
